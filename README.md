# Resonate
Git Repository for codes during the epic hack made by us at HackNYU 2018.

# Modules included
There are two major modules provided by the app.
1. Public Announcements encoding and decoding via audio steganography on inaudible high frequency sounds. These are decoded on the target device.
2. Converting speech to text, along with real time hyperlingual emotional prediction on text and audio streams to disambiguate intent.
